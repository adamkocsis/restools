# restools

The purpose of this small package is entirely selfish. Nothing makes me more infuriated than doing the same dumb thing over and over, that I could have solved once and for all. If only I could slowed down a bit and explored the opportunities...

This was supposed to be my quick library for research that I can use wherever I go - and whenever I want to - with continuous version tracking. This way I can use the same functions for my general reserach, develop my own tools, and can keep track of how they evolve over time. This is also of paramount importance for reproducibility, as I can always just refer to the version of the package I use - whenever I decide to use whichever version.

Of course this package come with absolutely no warranty or not even anything like it (not that any other stuff of mine does). If you decide to use this and find an error, just solve it yourself - the way I do it. Nevertheless, all the different versions that I use will will be archived here.
